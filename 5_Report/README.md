# PROJECT_GOALS:
The main objective of the calculator is to perform a calculation with response to user supplied input. The possible number of calculation in this calculator is Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication. The calculation and result are displayed in output page. 

# ADVANTAGES:
By using this matrix calculator we can calculate the complex matrix and the major use of this calculator is it reduce the time conception to solve the complex problems of the user by giving input and it displays the result.

# DISADVANTAGES:
It is designed only to calculate the basic operation in matrix. It can't calculate transpose, determination, etc.. This is the main disadvantage of this matrix calculator.

# CONCLUSION:
Thus, by using a basic of C code we can design an application to calculate the matrix operation and it is useful in calculating the operations for complex problems. The code I used is very understanable, and user-friendly
